# Visualization
Some fancy WebGL Visualizations.

## Setup
This repository can be ran locally by using [dde](http://github.com/whatwedo/dde).
After starting this project with `dde up` you can use `dde exec` to open a shell.

Run the following command inside the shell to start node:
```bash
npm run dev
```

You can now use [visualization.test](https://visualization.test) to call the website! ðŸŽ‰
